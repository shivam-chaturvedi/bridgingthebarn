Translatable infrastructure → Add a lightweight translation manager that wraps TranslationService/ML Kit so we can request a translated string by original English text and target language, caching results locally. Expose a TranslatableText widget or helper that listens to AppLanguageProvider and rebuilds when the selected language changes while showing the cached translation or original text while the async call is pending.
Vocabulary & category wiring → Replace hardcoded labels in the vocab screens (section titles, descriptions, vocabulary/phrase strings, category headers, “Tap to hear audio” prompt, etc.) with TranslatableText, ensuring both the main VocabScreen and every VocabTopicScreen entry point the helper so the entire UI updates instantly when a new language is chosen.
Data translation fallback → Add a translation cache and error handling so if ML Kit can’t translate (e.g., because the language isn’t fully supported), the UI gracefully falls back to English while showing a subtle loading state. Consider persisting translations by language/phrase during the session for smooth performance.
Testing & polish → Wire the settings dropdown so selecting a language triggers TranslatableText rebuilds, validate with flutter analyze/emulator, and highlight remaining limitations (e.g., only English → target languages for now).
